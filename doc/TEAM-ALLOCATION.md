# CoreGrid Mobile — Team Allocation

The main SRS already assigns each SE3090 group member end-to-end ownership of one business component —
backend, database, React, Flutter, tests, and one agent (§12, §18 of the
[main SRS](../../CoreGrid/doc/SRS/00-front-matter.md)). This document is that assignment translated into
**this repository's** `lib/features/` layout (`doc/MOBILE-SPECIFICATION.md` §3.1), so each member can find
their part here without re-deriving it from the main repo every time. Where the main SRS states Flutter
ownership explicitly (§12's "Flutter" row), this document just restates it against the concrete folder
names. Where it doesn't — the app shell, dashboard — this document proposes an owner and says so plainly, so
the group can ratify or reassign it rather than mistake it for something already decided.

## Roster

| Student | Component (main SRS) | Flutter features owned here | Branch prefix | Requirement range |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Student 1 — **Jayashan Guruge** | A — Asset Registry & QR Identification | `features/scan/`, `features/assets/` | `feature/asset-*` | FR-016–FR-032 |
| Student 2 — **Seneja Ramanayaka** | B — Maintenance Management | `features/maintenance/`, `features/notifications/` | `feature/maintenance-*` | FR-033–FR-042, FR-077–FR-080 |
| Student 3 — **Bhanuka Samarasinghe** | C — Transfer & Disposal | `features/transfers/` | `feature/transfer-*` | FR-043–FR-055 |
| Student 4 — **Hasitha Erandika** (Group Leader) | D — Audit & Compliance, org config, user admin | `features/verification/`, `features/workflows/`, plus the app shell (below) | `feature/audit-*` | FR-056–FR-066, FR-067–FR-069/FR-076 |

Branch prefixes reuse the exact ones already assigned in the main repo (§18.2) — same owner, same naming,
different repository, so there's one mental mapping per person rather than two.

### Student 1 — Jayashan Guruge — `features/scan/`, `features/assets/`

The device-feature centrepiece (§8, C-04): QR scan via `mobile_scanner` (FR-024, IF-06/IF-07/IF-10/IF-12),
manual code entry as the always-visible fallback (FR-025), the attribute-driven asset detail screen
(FR-020), condition update (FR-029), and the physical verification flow reached from asset detail
(FR-031 — `POST /api/assets/{id}/verify`, this component's named business-specific operation). Every other
screen that needs "resolve an asset from a scan or a code" (transfer receipt confirmation, verification
tasks) calls into `features/scan/`, so this is also the first Flutter feature that should be usable
end-to-end, not just the first one someone happens to pick.

### Student 2 — Seneja Ramanayaka — `features/maintenance/`, `features/notifications/`

Fault reporting with photo capture and client-side compression to ≤1MB (FR-033, IF-11), maintenance task
list and legal-transition-only progress updates (FR-037, FR-042), and the in-app notification list
(FR-080 — in this component's FR-077–080 range, alongside the backend `INotificationService`/email work
this same owner already does in the main repo). Photo upload depends on the object-storage integration in
the main SRS §11.3 (`IBlobStorageService`, Cloudflare R2 / any S3-compatible endpoint) — check that's wired
up backend-side before building the upload UI, not after.

### Student 3 — Bhanuka Samarasinghe — `features/transfers/`

Transfer request creation (FR-043) and scan-based receipt confirmation (FR-046, reusing
`features/scan/`). Disposal has no Flutter surface — it's React/Administrator-only per the responsibility
boundary (main SRS §3.4) — so this is the smallest single-feature scope of the four, which is expected: this
owner's larger share of the work is Component C's backend/React transfer-and-disposal engine, not Flutter.

### Student 4 — Hasitha Erandika (Group Leader) — `features/verification/`, `features/workflows/`, app shell

Verification-campaign task list and the field verification flow (FR-058, FR-059), manual discrepancy raising
(FR-061), and agent-status display (FR-067–FR-069, FR-076 — the main SRS's Flutter cell for this component
names "agent status display" explicitly). This owner's Flutter scope also includes the pieces §12/§18 don't
assign to any single component, because they're genuinely cross-cutting rather than missing an owner:

| Piece | Why it isn't in anyone's FR range | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `features/auth/` (sign-in, token storage, route guards) | FR-001–FR-009 sits outside every component's stated range — identity is foundational, not owned by one business component | Group Leader, same as this component already owns user administration/SCIM backend-side (§12) |
| `app/` (entry point, `go_router` config, `ProviderScope` root) | Not requirement-numbered at all — it's the scaffold every feature plugs into | Group Leader, consistent with already owning CI and the consolidated submission (§18.2.1) |
| `features/dashboard/` (FR-081–FR-083) | Aggregates every other component's data; the backend `Dashboard/` folder is similarly un-lettered in `CoreGrid/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Group Leader, built last once the other three features exist to summarise |

**This table is a recommendation, not a restatement of the main SRS** — if the group would rather split the
app shell differently (e.g. whoever finishes their own feature first bootstraps it), that's a fine
alternative; just update this file and `doc/PROGRESS.md` to match, since PROGRESS.md's per-requirement
status is what an evaluator or a teammate resuming later trusts.

## Build order

`features/auth/` and `app/` are the one piece every other feature depends on — nothing else can be
demonstrated without sign-in and a router to reach it — so they should land in week one, mirroring risk
R-01 in the main SRS (§15): a thin vertical slice, integrated early, never allowed to break. `features/scan/`
is next, since three other owners' features (`verification`, `transfers`, and indirectly `maintenance`'s
task list) call into it. `features/dashboard/` is deliberately last — it has nothing to summarise until the
other three exist.

## Testing and evidence

Each owner's contribution evidence requirements are identical to the main repo's (§12.1): a feature branch
per capability, a pull request reviewed by at least one other member, requirement IDs referenced in the
implementing issue/PR, and — per `CLAUDE.md` here — `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` passing before any
of that. The main SRS's rule that "work an owner cannot explain is treated as not delivered" applies here
exactly as it does to the backend and React work.
